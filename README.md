# Scraper Chatbot


In recent years, with the development of Machine Learning and what we call "natural language processing" (NLP) technology, chatbots have become extremely useful and popular. In addition, today's chatbots are smarter, faster and more useful than the first examples. 

Again, chatbot technology is based on "natural language processing" NLP technology, but the same technology has been used today to develop widely used voice-based virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Apple Siri or Microsoft Cortana.

__So, is it possible to build a chatbot without having Deep Learning knowledge or programming knowledge in general?__ __Yes!__



How? by using advance web scraping skills! Will we do scrape from Google? No, that's not possible, because we want to see a ready answer when we write a question. Google will bring us websites, and we do not know on which website the exact and logical answer to our question appears during the search.



That's why we need a platform that includes many questions and answers from people. Did Quora.com come to mind? Aha, that was the first thing that came to my mind, but unfortunately the quora doesn't allow me to scrap it. Can't find a way? Possible but illegal. But I thought it was such a treasure elsewhere, and I remembered the yahoo answers. The number of questions asked has already reached one billion. Does Yahoo allow you to use your own data? Yes!
